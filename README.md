# Nicholas Rodak | Strategic Intelligence & Operations Portfolio

Strategic Intelligence & Operations Portfolio

This repository demonstrates the technical execution of intelligence tradecraft.

While traditional analysis stops at the report, this portfolio focuses on operationalizing intelligence—building the automated Python pipelines, mock-driven frameworks, and "Minimum Viable Systems" required to answer Key Intelligence Questions (KIQs) in real-time.

Core Focus: Bridging the gap between high-level strategic intent and technical reality.
